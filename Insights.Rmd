Start off with pulling in the data and seeing what we got

```{r}
library(readxl)
Raw_Data <- read_excel("Raw Data.xlsx", col_types = c("text","text"))
```
```{r}
head(Raw_Data,4)
tail(Raw_Data,4)
```

Looks like there's still dates in there. So I'll remove any `-` `/` or  `0-9`
```{r, echo=FALSE,results='hide', include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```
```{r}
df<-Raw_Data%>%
  mutate(Word=str_replace_all(Word,'[0-9]|/|-',""))
head(df,4)
tail(df,4)
```

Okay so the **Word** field is cleaned up. Now let's get the date into a date
format so that we can sort it correctly
```{r}
df<-df%>%
  mutate(Date=as.Date(Date,"%m/%d/%y"))
head(df,4)
tail(df,4)
```

Awesome, everything is formatted right. But we have some missing Dates.
Let's fill those with `xxxxxxxx`
